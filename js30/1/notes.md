Key code: numbers associated with keypress, [cheatsheet](https://www.toptal.com/developers/keycode) to tell you rather than guessing

data-key attribute: not standard, a "data attribute"; if you want to make up a new attribute, like a key, it has to be preceded by "data" (pulling from some kind of data)

using timeouts in CSS *and* JS are really easy to desync, e.x. if a designer changes the CSS timeout now your JS timeout is broken

clickEvent: event saying somebody clicked me
similar events saying I (element) transitioned (in CSS)

in an array of elements, you can't automatically listen on all of them in vanilla JS; must iterate over them

takeaways: key events, listening for transition and events (can do the same with animations)
